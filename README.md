# soil_co2_flux
Soil CO2 flux prediction using in-situ measurements via Q10, modified Q10 and Random Forest models

The data used here includes:-

The daily soil CO2 flux data observed from LICOR's Automated Soil COâ‚‚ Flux System over a dry deciduous forest system in India.

The variables soil water content (SWC), soil temperature (T_soil), atmospheric temperature (T_air), relative humidity (RH), incoming long-wave (RAD_lw) and short-wave radiation (RAD_sw), and soil heat flux (SHF) and the difference between atmospheric and soil temperatures (T_diff)

Hourly data from 2015 to 2016 were used for training and testing the models. Variables from 2018 for prediction.
